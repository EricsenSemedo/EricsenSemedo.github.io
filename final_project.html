                My program, "Starfighter Assault," is a space-themed shooter game developed in ProcessingJS. It's designed to engage players in navigating a spaceship, avoiding and shooting enemies, and earning points for successful hits. The game is structured across several screens including a home screen, gameplay screen, and a game-over screen, enhancing the interactive experience.
                Gameplay Instructions:
                Home Screen: Start by clicking the 'Play' button to launch into the action.
                Gameplay Screen: Use 'W' and 'S' keys to move your spaceship up and down. Press the spacebar to shoot lasers at incoming enemies. The aim is to destroy these enemies before they pass your ship. Each destroyed enemy increases your score.
                Game Over Screen: If an enemy collides with your spaceship, the game ends, and you will see your final score. The game currently requires a restart to play again.
                Features:
                Interactive Controls: Simple keyboard inputs for movement and firing provide a user-friendly interface.
                Dynamic Enemy Generation: Enemies appear at random, offering a varied challenge each playthrough.
                Collision Detection: The game includes mechanisms to detect collisions between lasers and enemies as well as between enemies and the playerâ€™s ship.
                Scoring System: Points are awarded for shooting down enemies, adding a competitive edge to the gameplay.
                This game offers a straightforward yet engaging way to enjoy a classic arcade-style shooter, perfect for quick entertainment breaks.
